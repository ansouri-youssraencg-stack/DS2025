The dataset was developed as part of a project aiming to reduce academic dropout and failure in higher education by using machine learning to identify students at risk early in their studies. It contains information available at the time of enrollment, including academic background, demographic details, and socio-economic factors. The main goal is to classify students into three categories—dropout, enrolled, or graduate—by the end of the normal course duration. The project was funded by the SATDAP program (Capacitação da Administração Pública) under grant POCI-05-5762-FSE-000191 in Portugal. Each record in the dataset represents one student, and the data were split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Prior to analysis, extensive preprocessing was carried out to remove anomalies, outliers, and missing values, ensuring a complete and reliable dataset.
